# WeatherAPP

Created a simple Weather App in Django using API. 
This project displays the current weather of the different cities. The main aim was to learn how API works.

## How to run?

Requirements -> Django, Python Installed

Steps --> Download this repository -> Unzip -> Open CMD -> Write Path of Folder -> command "python manage.py runserver"

note: use your own API key.


Thank you!
